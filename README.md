# Email Sender
A simple starter email form that process the information and use a controller to sanitize the data.
The email sender is based on https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

# Usage
Download the package then from the terminal and get inside the project folder then run **"composer install"** to download all the php dependencies.

Then rename the **.env.example** file to **.env** and fill the file with your desired values. In this magic file you can add whatevere variable you want ad of course delete or rename the ones that exist already. Just keep in mind that with the initial configuration some variables are required to make the sender works.

Always inside the project folder run **"npm install"** to install all other dev dependencies (???still work in progress???).

Now you can use your form as you wish and customize as much as you want.
